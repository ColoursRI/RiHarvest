# RiHarvest
A Potion Craft mod which allows you to apply growth and harvest bonuses to your garden using your potions.

<h2>How to use</h2>
A potion is applied to your garden by simply grabbing it from your inventory and placing it somewhwere in the garden. The potion will be consumed, and its effects will be applied to the garden. Potion effects can stack, but only to a certain extent. You will be prevented from oversaturating your garden.

**Growth I**: Your garden will grow extra overnight. Some plants that would have taken a few days will now be ready in the morning.
**Growth II**: Your garden will grow extra overnight. Even more plants that would have taken a few days will now be ready in the morning.
**Growth III**: Your garden will grow extra immediately. In addition, a few Plants that would have taken a few days will also now be ready in the morning.


**Harvest** **I**, **II**, **III**: Each plant that grows while a Harvest effect is active will have a chance to grow with a larger amount of ingredients available to harvest. The stronger the potion, the higher the chances for bonus ingredients and the longer the effect will last.
